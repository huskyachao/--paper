# Detection of Electromagnetic Interference Attacks on Sensor Systems

## Summary
1. Proposed a defensive method against EMI (EMI attack on the wire between the sensor and the microcontroller)
2. Basic idea: the signal of a turned-off sensor should be 0V or some other known value.
3. method: modulate the sensor output in a way that is unpredictable to the attacker (turn on/off the sensor according to randomly Manchester encoding), if controller detects fluctuations, then the attacking signal can be detected.
4. 
5. 
## Challenge
1. Existing method: shielding and EMI filters (cannot full block interference, cannot detect)
## Main idea
The attacking signal is obvious when the sensor is turned off (e.g., disturbance on 0V level). So the authors turn on/off the sensor according to randomly Manchester encoding which is unpredicted by the attacker. (A normal sensor is working continuously.)
