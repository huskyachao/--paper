# Detection of Electromagnetic Interference Attacks on Sensor Systems

## Summary
1. Proposed a defensive method against EMI (EMI attack on the wire between the sensor and the microcontroller)
2. Basic idea: The attacking signal is more obvious when the sensor is turned off. By turning on/off the sensor periodically (Manchester encoding), we can detect the attack signal during the off period and keep the sensor working in the mean while.
3. method: modulate the sensor output in a way that is unpredictable to the attacker (turn on/off the sensor according to randomly Manchester encoding), if controller detects fluctuations, then the attacking signal can be detected.
4. 
5. 
## Challenge
1. Existing method: shielding and EMI filters (cannot full block interference, cannot detect)
2. 
## Main idea
The attacking signal is obvious when the sensor is turned off (e.g., disturbance on 0V level). So the authors turn on/off the sensor according to randomly Manchester encoding which is unpredicted by the attacker. (A normal sensor is working continuously.)
## Strength

## Weakness
1. whether turn on/off the sensor frequently will impact the usability of the sensor?
2. Unreasonable assumption: "we assume that the attaker knows voltage levels, but she does not know wether the voltage level transitions from high to 0V or from 0V to high..." Manchester encoding 是可以根据每一个周期的起始值来判断该周期是0还是1(例如接连两个周期不变的话，周期间隙会有跳变沿)，因此攻击者可以先需要观察一定数目的周期，估计出Bias Voltage Generator进行Manchester encoding的周期，然后在监听接下来的信号的起始值来判断该周期是0还是1，从而完成更为准确的预测。
