# Detection of Electromagnetic Interference Attacks on Sensor Systems

## Summary
1. Proposed a detection method for low-level (low-power) EMI attack (target on the wire between the sensor and the microcontroller).
2. Basic idea: The attacking signal is more obvious when the sensor is turned off. By turning on/off the sensor periodically (Manchester encoding), we can detect the attack signal during the off period and keep the sensor working in the mean while.
3. Method: modulate the sensor output in a way that is unpredictable to the attacker (turn on/off the sensor according to randomly Manchester encoding), if controller detects fluctuations (both during the on and off period), then the attacking signal can be detected.
4. Evaluation: both on a temperature system and a microphone system (whose physical quantity is constant during a short measurement).

## Challenge (technical)
no big challenge but some regular practical challenges.
- how to synchronize the digitized signal and teh secret Manchester code sequence: By introducing preamble
- how to handle samples in the rising or falling edges: Remove
- how to determine the voltage level of zero samples: set threshold (noise tolerance)

## Main idea
The attacking signal is obvious when the sensor is turned off (e.g., disturbance on 0V level). So the authors turn on/off the sensor according to randomly Manchester encoding which is unpredicted by the attacker. (A normal sensor is working continuously.)
## Strength
1. Existing method: shielding and EMI filters (cannot full block interference, cannot detect)
2. separate the work period into working and detecting by switching the 
## Weakness
1. whether turn on/off the sensor frequently will impact the usability of the sensor?
2. Unreasonable assumption: "we assume that the attaker knows voltage levels, but she does not know wether the voltage level transitions from high to 0V or from 0V to high..." Manchester encoding 是可以根据每一个周期的起始值来判断该周期是0还是1(例如接连两个周期不变的话，周期间隙会有跳变沿)，因此攻击者可以先需要观察一定数目的周期，估计出Bias Voltage Generator进行Manchester encoding的周期，然后在监听接下来的信号的起始值来判断该周期是0还是1，从而完成更为准确的预测。

3. experiment: limited attacking distance (10cm for microphone and 1cm for thermistor) to inject the malicious signal. (the authors demostrated that they "want to realize the remote injection with a low power of the ... signal generator.")
4. Singular frequency auido signal; the doubtble significance of attack using a single frequency audio signal to inject
5. cannot recover the physical quantity from the cases of being attacked.(univeral problem?)

## Inspiration
1. Spoofing attack detection + Manchester encoding or sth. else?
2. Remote EMI attack (by some accumulate effects or persistant fault injection?)
