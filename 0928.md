# [VELODY: Nonlinear Vibration Challenge-Response for Resilient User Authentication](https://wisest.ece.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/740/2019/09/Velody_CCS2019_Jingjie.pdf) (CCS'19)
## Summary
- Acoustic vibration has different harmonics and intermodulation under different acoustic emulation. The attenuations at different frequencies is different when going through different multipath.

- Four kinds of attacks
  - zero-effort attack
  - imopersonation
  - raw signal replay attack
  - synthesis attack
- Challenge desing
  - requirments: distinguishable (among users); distinguishable (among challenges) + unpredictable
  - chirp + sinusoidal wave
- Feature processing
  - alignment and segment + bandpass filtering
  - Ceptral feature (MFCC) + Statistical feature of ceptral feature (mean, variance,...)
- Classification (OC-kNN, an instance-based classifier)
  - mapminmax --> weight --> distance dj --> threshold estimation
- Evaluation
  - Hardware: Surface (copper plate lying on a ploymer foam pad), Stimuli (loudspeaker), Receiver (two contact microphones (accelerometers))
  - data collection: 15 subjects, three data collection sesssions (intra/inte-days), fixed hand shape for consistent alignment
  - Metrics: FNR (usibility), FPR (security), EER (FNR==FPR)
## Challenge

## Strength

## Weakness
- the position of hands/speaker/receiver, data collection process (all at one time?)
- the sound level of the speaker
- authentication time
- when a new user entrolls. the thresholds should be re-calculated? Or the threshold only correlates with the baseline response without hand contact?
- the evaluation about the three kinds of synthesis attack is not convictive.
## Inspiration
***Nonlinear vibra-response --> nonlinear mm-response***
### mmWave-based Palmprint
- device: IWR1642 or 120GHz radar
- Goal:
  - authentication
  - recover pixel-level palmprint (collect 50 mm-palprint and 50 pixel-palmprint at one time)
### mmWave-based fingerprint
- device: 120GHz radar



## Short-Range Audio Channels Security: Survey of Mechanisms, Applications, and Research Challenges

### Vocie Controllable System 
- Voice capture + Speech recognition + Cmd execution
- Activation Stage ("Hey Google") + Recognition Stage (NLP)
### Active attacks
  - Malware (attack against the voice assistant): strong limitation about the execution of the malware
  - [Unintelligitble but Audible audio signal](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot15/woot15-paper-vaidya.pdf): audible and white box (assumes some knowledge of the victim's speech recognition system by the attack)

  - [Inaudible-Dolphin Attack (Modulated on Ultrasonic)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3133956.3134052)

  ### Passive attacks (Covert listening deivce)
- [Recovery printed words on dot-matrix printers, but not ink-jet or laser printers (microphone, 10cm, ML-based, contexct)](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec10/tech/full_papers/Backes.pdf)
  - [similar attack on manufacturing system](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/2984464.2984483)
- Keyboards (Limited real applicatbility by the proximity)
  - [keystroke-Sounds-based + fft feature + Neural network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1301311)
  - [Improved (unlabled keystrokes + Cepturm feature)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1609956.1609959)

    - [Handwriting on the same ]

## Defense
- Synthetic sounds: white noise/random sounds to pollute the side-channel, or dedicated sounds to cheat the attacker.
- Masking sound: should be evaluated against Independent Component Analysis (ICA) attack.
- Usability discussion: addtional components, extra action of the user (degradation on user experience)
