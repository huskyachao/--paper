## Short-Range Audio Channels Security: Survey of Mechanisms, Applications, and Research Challenges

### Vocie Controllable System 
- Voice capture + Speech recognition + Cmd execution
- Activation Stage ("Hey Google") + Recognition Stage (NLP)
### Active attacks
  - Malware (attack against the voice assistant): strong limitation about the execution of the malware
  - [Unintelligitble but Audible audio signal](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot15/woot15-paper-vaidya.pdf): audible and white box (assumes some knowledge of the victim's speech recognition system by the attack)
    - [Overcome some limitations](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_carlini.pdf)
  - [Inaudible-Dolphin Attack (Modulated on Ultrasonic)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3133956.3134052) 
  - [Voice conversion spoofing attacks: mimic the user's voice wihout modifying its content](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6694344)
  ### Passive attacks (Covert listening deivce)
- [Recovery printed words on dot-matrix printers, but not ink-jet or laser printers (microphone, 10cm, ML-based, contexct)](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec10/tech/full_papers/Backes.pdf)
  - [similar attack on manufacturing system](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/2984464.2984483)
- Keyboards (Limited real applicatbility by the proximity)
  - [keystroke-Sounds-based + fft feature + Neural network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1301311)
  - [Improved (unlabled keystrokes + Cepturm feature)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1609956.1609959)
  - [Keystroke-Position-based (No training phase but Statistical properties of English language)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1180405.1180436)
    - [Handwriting on the same ]

## Defense
- Synthetic sounds: white noise/random sounds to pollute the side-channel, or dedicated sounds to cheat the attacker.
- Masking sound: should be evaluated against Independent Component Analysis (ICA) attack.
- Usability discussion: addtional components, extra action of the user
