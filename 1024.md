## Exploring LoRa for Long-range Through-wall Sensing
### Summary
- LoRa (chirp-based) for human respiration sensing (25m, 15m for through wall) and tracking (30m, from one room to another room).
- Experiments:
  -  fe

### Challenge

### Novelty
- Propose to utilize the ***Ratio of signals*** received by two different antennas at the Rx, which helps to 
  - cancel out the noise and improve the sensing range (by the ***division operation***) according to eq.5.
  - cancel out the negtive impact of random signal phase offset caused by the time-asynchronization between the Tx and Rx (because the phase offset is the common divisor on the two Rx antennas).

### Strength

### Weakness
- The 
- The theoretic assumes that the complex signal on the I/Q plane can be a circular. But 
- The s
- The so-called tracking: the walking direction estimation is not convincing. Only take forward/back into consideration?
