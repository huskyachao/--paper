## Exploring LoRa for Long-range Through-wall Sensing
### Summary
- LoRa (chirp-based) for human respiration sensing (25m, 15m for through wall) and tracking (30m, from one room to another room).
- Key idea: the proposed Ratio of Received signal of two Rx.  
- System Implementation
  - LoRa node (Arduino Uno) with one Tx and two Rx
  - Gateway (USRP B210 and GNU Radio)
- Experiments
  - Sensing range: 18m~35m (outdoor), 25m~50m (indoor)
  - Sensing Granularity: 1mm (25m)

### Novelty
- Propose to utilize the ***Ratio of signals*** received by two different antennas at the Rx, which helps to 
  - cancel out the noise and improve the sensing range (by the ***division operation***) according to eq.5.
  - cancel out the negtive impact of random signal phase offset caused by the time-asynchronization between the Tx and Rx (because the phase offset is the common divisor on the two Rx antennas).
### Strength
- long-range (5m to 25m, 5m to 15m for through wall) human respiration rate sensing
- mm-level movement (back and forth) sensing for long-range sensing.
- Robust to indoor environment changes as the LoRa signal can penetrate the wall as wall as these furniture.
### Weakness
- The theoretic assumes that the complex signal on the I/Q plane can be a circular. But it is not true in realistic which lacks related discussion.
- The so-called tracking: the walking direction estimation is not convincing. Only take forward/back into consideration?
