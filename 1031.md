## [Exploring LoRa for Long-range Through-wall Sensing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3397326)
### Summary
- LoRa (chirp-based) for human respiration sensing (25m, 15m for through wall) and tracking (30m, from one room to another room).
- Key idea: the proposed Ratio of Received signal of two Rx.  
- System Implementation
  - LoRa node (Arduino Uno) with one Tx and two Rx
  - Gateway (USRP B210 and GNU Radio)
- Experiments
  - Sensing range: 18m~35m (outdoor), 25m~50m (indoor)
  - Sensing Granularity: 1mm (25m)

### Novelty
- Propose to utilize the ***Ratio of signals*** received by two different antennas at the Rx, which helps to 
  - cancel out the noise and improve the sensing range (by the ***division operation***) according to eq.5.
  - cancel out the negtive impact of random signal phase offset caused by the time-asynchronization between the Tx and Rx (because the phase offset is the common divisor on the two Rx antennas).
### Strength
- long-range (5m to 25m, 5m to 15m for through wall) human respiration rate sensing
- mm-level movement (back and forth) sensing for long-range sensing.
- Robust to indoor environment changes as the LoRa signal can penetrate the wall as wall as these furniture.
### Weakness
- The theoretic assumes that the complex signal on the I/Q plane can be a circular. But it is not true in realistic which lacks related discussion.
- The so-called tracking: the walking direction estimation is not convincing. Only take forward/back into consideration?

## [WiBorder: Precise Wi-Fi based Boundary Sensing via Through-wall Discrimination](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3411834)
### Summary
- Proposed a innovative technique for accurate determination of wifi sensing boundary: DCM-CSI, a novel CSI metric from the conjugate-multiplying CSI, capable of distinguishing direct and indirect signals.
- Proposed 
  - a wifi intrution detection system: 99.4% detection rate 
  - an area detection system: 97.03% detection rate
### Intuition of WiBorder
- the impact of inside-wall and outside-wall activities (i.e., direct and indirect/through-wall reflected signals) to wifi can be different, which can be utilized for intrution detection.
- the mathematical relationship between human movement and DCM-CSI is the derieved variation parameter after applying conjugate operation to one of the two antennas' samples. 
### Experiments
- Intrusion detection
- Area detection: multiple Rx 

### Weakness
- The impact of environment changes?
- what determines the threshold of discrimination? is the distance between the Tx and Rx?

## [MagHacker: Eavesdropping on Stylus Pen Writing via Magnetic Sensing from Commodity Mobile Devices](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386901.3389030)
### Summary

### Solved Problems
- Using only one magneticmeter on the commodity device to eavesdrop compared with other works using multiple custom magnetometers.
### Main Idea
The magnetometer readings can be divided into small segments and translated into writing trajectories for letter recognition.
### The proposed sytem
- segmentation: exploit the fluctuation of human's speed of hand movement in writing which changes less frequently in transition between letters.
  -  compute mean amplitude of CWT spectrum --> the highst derivative after each valley of mean amplitude can be considered as the starting point of writing next letter.
- handwriting trajectories: coordinate projection and transformation
  - 3D magnetometer data --> 2D plane trajectories
- Recognition: CNN (with training data augmentation)
### Experiments
- Setup: 
  - Stylus pen and smartphone with a distance of 10cm.
  - Three English letters every time: L1L2L1
  - Repeat five times for each
  - Uppercase and Lowercase letter are **separately** collected.
- Results:
  - Lowercase/uppercase: 77.7% / 80.1%
  - 15cm/20cm: 70%/60%
  - Writing speed: 1 letter/sec(>75%)
  - Different position (the speaker of smartphone cause great degradation on the performance)
  - Different stylus pen models (87.1%)
  - Different surounding electronic devices, i.e., laptop aside, wearing watch on the left hand (around 85% without great variation)

<!-- ### Strengths -->
<!-- - The emphasized low attacking costs: using a single magnetometer on commodity mobile devices to eavesdrop on human's handwriting. -->
