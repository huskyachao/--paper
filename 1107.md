## [mmVib: Micrometer-Level Vibration Measurement with mmWave Radar]()
### Summary
- It proposes a practical approach to measure micrometer-level vibration with mmWave radar (IWR1642).
- It indroduces a Multi-signal Consolidation (MSC) model to describe the properties of the reflected signals, we exploit the inherent consistency among those signals to accurately recover the vibration characteristics.
- The experiments show that this design achieves 8.2% relative amplitude error and 0.5% relative frequency error in median. The median amplitude error is 3.4ùë¢ùëö for the 100ùë¢ùëö-amplitude vibration
### Novelty and Insight
- It proposes a MSC model to measure micrometer-level vibration using mmWave radar.
- Insight: increasing the number of observations of the same vibration helps to control measurement errors.
### Multi-signal Consolidation Model
It describes the reflected signal in the I and Q domain and exploit the inherent consistency among those signals to recover the vibration characteristics.
- Multi-frequency: by changing the starting frequency of the chirps in a frame and get multiple observations of a arc in the I/Q domain.
- Multi-antenna (Rx): not only provides multiple observations but also offer an opportunity to refine the measurement.
### Strength
- mmWave radar to measure the micrometer-level vibration by proposing the MSC.
- The MSC and system design is detailed and well-written.
### Weakness
- There is no experiment about higher virbation frequency (above 500Hz) to the measurement.
- what about a larger virbating surface (The impact of a large vibrating surface to the AoA estimation of vibration refinement)?  
- What about the vibration mesurement of multiple objects when they fall into the same range-bin (i.e., close to each other).

## [Towards Physical-Layer Vibration Sensing with RFIDs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8737592)
### Summary
- This paper proposes TagSound, an RFID-based vibration sensing system that explores a tag‚Äôs harmonic backscattering to recover high-frequency and tiny mechanical vibrations accurately. (***But the implementation: RFID + USRP***)
### Solved problem
- Current RFID-based vibration measurement solution can only sense low frequency ( < 100Hz) vibration with larger amplitude ( > 5mm).
- TagSound can achieve a mean error of 0.37Hz (f<100Hz) and 4.2Hz(f=2500Hz)
### Experimental Setup
- RFID: antenna, ImpinJ Reader, Tag
- ***USRP N210 with 1 directional antenna (Monitor the backscatter signal of RFID)***
