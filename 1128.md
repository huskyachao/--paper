## AdvPulse: Universal, Synchronization-free, and Targeted Audio Adversarial Attacks via Subsecond Perturbations
### Summary
The author propose a method to generate subsecond-level audio perturbations to alter the recognition results of the ASR system. The proposed method do not need prior knowledge about the targets audio and can operate in a synchronization manner. 
### Challenge
- No prior knowledge about what the victim says
- Asychronization between the adversarial perturbation and the speech

### Novelty
- Most existing attacks need to apply the perturbation to the audio within the whole duration.
- The proposed attack method do not need prior knowledge about the target, which makes it significantly different from existing over-the-air audio adversarial attacks.
- It can works in a asynchronization manner. But Most existing attacks are absed on the assumption that the input audio and the generated adversarial perturbation are strictly synchronized.
- Black-box attack?
### Attack scenarios
- Static-speech attack: the audio input is mixed with the adversarial perturbation and played by the adversary.
- Streaming-speech attack (OVer-th-air): the adversary injects the adversarial perturbation by a loudspeaker while the ASR interacting with a real person.

- Target models: X-vector system (state-of-the-art text-independent DNN-based model)
 ### Basic idea
