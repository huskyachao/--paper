## AdvPulse: Universal, Synchronization-free, and Targeted Audio Adversarial Attacks via Subsecond Perturbations
### Summary
The author propose a method to generate subsecond-level audio perturbations to alter the recognition results of the ASR system. The proposed method do not need prior knowledge about the targets audio and can operate in a synchronization manner. 
### Challenge
- No prior knowledge about what the victim says
- Asychronization between the adversarial perturbation and the speech

### Novelty
- Most existing attacks need to apply the perturbation to the audio within the whole duration.
- The proposed attack method do not need prior knowledge about the target, which makes it significantly different from existing over-the-air audio adversarial attacks.
- It can works in a asynchronization manner. But Most existing attacks are absed on the assumption that the input audio and the generated adversarial perturbation are strictly synchronized.
- Black-box attack?
### Attack scenarios
- Static-speech attack: the audio input is mixed with the adversarial perturbation and played by the adversary.
- Streaming-speech attack (Over-th-air): the adversary injects the adversarial perturbation by a loudspeaker while the ASR interacting with a real person.

- Target models: X-vector system (state-of-the-art text-independent DNN-based model)
 ### Basic idea
- Synchronization-free
  - Commonly, the feature-map of speaker recognition is derived by segmenting raw data into several segmented frames and then concateing them together into a feature-map. Thus, it is possible to fool the model by introducing a short perturbation into part of the features before the feature aggregation.
  1. Feasibility 
   - Thus, we can solve the following optimal adversarial problem to generate the perturbations:

  2. Subsecond perturbation generation
    - optimal problem with time delay:

        The author sample random time delays with a step size of 1 digit sample.
- Universal (targeted)
  - a set of training data samples sampled from the distribution u. Iterate through each data sample to update the adversarial perturbation by applying gradients.
- Practical Over-the-Air Attack
  - Using band-pass filter to cope with speaker&microphone limitations. (adding band-pass constraints into the optimization equation)
  - Absorption and Reverberation (affected by the envionment layouts): using a group of RIRs (Room Impulse Response) collected in various environments to improve the robustness of the generated adversarial perturbation.
### limitation
- Impact of environment noise?
